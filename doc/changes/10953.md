- Support HaikuOS: don't call `execve` since it's not allowed if other pthreads
  have been created. (@Sylvain78, #10953)
  The fact that haiku can't call execve from other threads than the principal thread of a process (a team in haiku jargon), is a discrepancy to POSIX and hence there is a [bug about it](https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/18665).
